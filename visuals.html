			<p>Designspiration is a website meant to help designers inspire one another. This website has a normal search feature, where you can look up images using words that have been cataloged with that image. However, images can also found based on color. When searching this way, the user is provided a color chart where they can choose up to 5 colors to search at once. I think this is an interesting feature that can help designers think about design when looking at other peoples work.

			<p>Switchcam.com is a music website which looks for videos on the internet taken at concerts. This website combines different angels of a concert to give the viewer a full view of what it would like to be at the concert. This website is interesting because they are able to make an enhanced experience for the viewer while keeping the authenticity of the concert going experience.

This story talks about the new operating system layout that Apple is releasing for its mobile devices. The story focuses on the comparison between the older operating system layouts verses the new i0S 7. The older operating systems tried to make icons and textures resemble things that users would find in the real world, for example: A shutter for the camera, Green felt in the game room. However, Apple now believes that users have come to the point where they don't need these kind of visual cues to help them feel comfortable with the phone. 
I find it interesting to see this kind of shift going on in our culture. These types of mobile devices have only been around for a few years, however, they have become so a part of our everyday lives that we almost intuitively use them.

			The Johnny Cash Project is a world wide collaborative website where users draw Johnny Cash related pictures to contribute to the site. The website then categorizes the pictures and lets people vote on which ones they like in order to create a music video set to Ain't No Grave, by Johnny Cash. As stated in the About page on the website, the music video is ever-changing due to the nature of the website. This is an interesting website because it uses the power of the internet to create a global piece of art that continues to evolve.

			Here is another project created by Aaron Koblin (the creator of the Johnny Cash project.) This website, called Flight Patterns, is a site that visually displays flight tracking information in the United States. The accumulation of flight data forms an image of the US. THis website is interesting because it takes raw data to create a piece of art that, like the Johnny Cash Project, can continue to change.

			This website is Arcade Fires new video. On this website, your webcam and smartphone will interact so that the user is able to be a part of the video and add "reflections" to the video. I believe this type of usability is the future of the internet as it will let the user have a more immersive experience. </div>

			<div class="omega">
			The Redbull Revolutions in Sound website has some pretty interesting displays and effects. All the small circles that float around the bigger, center circle, do actually float. They move around and bump into one another. When the small circles do bump into another, they move in opposite directions. I think this website is interesting because of how well this code was executed. Although just a little bonus feature that might get overlooked for the most part, it seems like a lot of thought went into planning this feature. </div>

			Again, a website with a lot of subtle things that make it very interesting. First if you move your cursor around the red 55 area, it will create shapes. The most interesting part of the site is after you get into it. As you scroll down any of the pages, the whole site goes from having margin on the right and left to a full bleed. This makes it feel like everything is expanding as you move down. </div>

			It's very difficult to tell that this website is made to promote a TV show. The design of the site is very straight forward and deceptively simple which gives it a futuristic feel. As you move down the site, the parallax scrolling (i think) lets the site bring in new content very fluidly but rigidly which further gives the site a futuristic feel. This website is able to bring together interesting Jquery features that make it visually pleasing as you move through it.   </div>

			<div class="omega">
			This website is interesting because it is able to use your webcam to tell whether the lights are on or off in the area where your computer is located. Whats even more amazing is that when the lights are off it starts drawing or putting together a series of images (like you're dreaming). These image patterns keep going on as long as the light is off and stop when the lights are turned on, at which point the dreamer on the screen wakes up. Not only do the drawings on the site when sleeping seem to all be unique but the interactivity of light is a great idea and a powerful tool for designers. </div>

			<div class="omega">
			Jim Carry's website is visually stunning. It has a collage aesthetic which adds a lot of movement to the site. However, it doesn't stop there. Each piece of artwork on the site could be an easter egg that the user can play with. Furthermore if you click on the right part of the site, it will transport you to another part of the site and make it feel as though you are actually moving there. </div>
