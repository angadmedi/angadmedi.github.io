	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>DESIGNSPIRATION</em></div>
	Designspiration is a website meant to help designers inspire one another. This website has a normal search feature, where you can look up images using words that have been cataloged with that image. However, images can also found based on color. When searching this way, the user is provided a color chart where they can choose up to 5 colors to search at once. I think this is an interesting feature that can help designers think about design when looking at other peoples work. </div>

	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>SWITCH CAM</em></div>
	Switchcam.com is a music website which looks for videos on the internet taken at concerts. This website combines different angels of a concert to give the viewer a full view of what it would like to be at the concert. This website is interesting because they are able to make an enhanced experience for the viewer while keeping the authenticity of the concert going experience.

	This story talks about the new operating system layout that Apple is releasing for its mobile devices. The story focuses on the comparison between the older operating system layouts verses the new i0S 7. The older operating systems tried to make icons and textures resemble things that users would find in the real world, for example: A shutter for the camera, Green felt in the game room. However, Apple now believes that users have come to the point where they don't need these kind of visual cues to help them feel comfortable with the phone. 
I find it interesting to see this kind of shift going on in our culture. These types of mobile devices have only been around for a few years, however, they have become so a part of our everyday lives that we almost intuitively use them.

	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>JOHNNY CASH PROJECT</em></div>
	The Johnny Cash Project is a world wide collaborative website where users draw Johnny Cash related pictures to contribute to the site. The website then categorizes the pictures and lets people vote on which ones they like in order to create a music video set to Ain't No Grave, by Johnny Cash. As stated in the About page on the website, the music video is ever-changing due to the nature of the website. This is an interesting website because it uses the power of the internet to create a global piece of art that continues to evolve.

	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>FLIGHT PATTERNS</em></div>
	Here is another project created by Aaron Koblin (the creator of the Johnny Cash project.) This website, called Flight Patterns, is a site that visually displays flight tracking information in the United States. The accumulation of flight data forms an image of the US. THis website is interesting because it takes raw data to create a piece of art that, like the Johnny Cash Project, can continue to change.

	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>REFLEKTOR</em></div>
	This website is Arcade Fires new video. On this website, your webcam and smartphone will interact so that the user is able to be a part of the video and add "reflections" to the video. I believe this type of usability is the future of the internet as it will let the user have a more immersive experience.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>RED BULL REVOLUTION</em></div>
	The Redbull Revolutions in Sound website has some pretty interesting displays and effects. All the small circles that float around the bigger, center circle, do actually float. They move around and bump into one another. When the small circles do bump into another, they move in opposite directions. I think this website is interesting because of how well this code was executed. Although just a little bonus feature that might get overlooked for the most part, it seems like a lot of thought went into planning this feature.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>55.COM</em></div>
	Again, a website with a lot of subtle things that make it very interesting. First if you move your cursor around the red 55 area, it will create shapes. The most interesting part of the site is after you get into it. As you scroll down any of the pages, the whole site goes from having margin on the right and left to a full bleed. This makes it feel like everything is expanding as you move down.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>MEET YOUR MX</em></div>
	It's very difficult to tell that this website is made to promote a TV show. The design of the site is very straight forward and deceptively simple which gives it a futuristic feel. As you move down the site, the parallax scrolling (i think) lets the site bring in new content very fluidly but rigidly which further gives the site a futuristic feel. This website is able to bring together interesting Jquery features that make it visually pleasing as you move through it.

	</div>
	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>ANASOMNIA</em></div>
	This website is interesting because it is able to use your webcam to tell whether the lights are on or off in the area where your computer is located. Whats even more amazing is that when the lights are off it starts drawing or putting together a series of images (like you're dreaming). These image patterns keep going on as long as the light is off and stop when the lights are turned on, at which point the dreamer on the screen wakes up. Not only do the drawings on the site when sleeping seem to all be unique but the interactivity of light is a great idea and a powerful tool for designers

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>JIM CARRY</em></div>
	Jim Carry's website is visually stunning. It has a collage aesthetic which adds a lot of movement to the site. However, it doesn't stop there. Each piece of artwork on the site could be an easter egg that the user can play with. Furthermore if you click on the right part of the site, it will transport you to another part of the site and make it feel as though you are actually moving there.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>MUSICOVERY</em></div>
	Musicovery is a great way to discover new music. It is a website that plays music depending on the mood that you're in. The four main choices are "energetic", "calm", "positive" and "dark". But this is just where the site starts helping you narrowing the field of music you might be interested in any given time. The website also has a tool which lets you move between these 4 groups get capture a more accurate version of your mood and prescribe better music for you. Moreover, you can decide what genre of music you'd like to hear and what decade the songs come from.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>SPEKTRA</em></div>
	MSNBC's Spectra section of their website is a unique, interactive way to look at news. Not does it color code different types of news items in its drop down menu, the drop downs actually fall down once you choose them. These chosen drop down menu items do float back up on the screen except in an expanded format so that you can get very specific with what news you read. You can choose different news/cultural items to read about and the interactions of these sections makes a cool design.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>MERCEDES BENZ</em></div>
	Mercedes has a very neat website. As you scroll down you get more information about the car. But the interesting thing is that as you scroll down the background video plays. This is a very specific use of the paralax scrolling but seems to work well to give you the feeling that you're moving on the road while also showing you the car that Mercedes is selling.

	<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 blogtext">
	<div class="col-xs-12 blogsubhead"><em>STUMBLE UPON</em></div>
	Stumble Upon is a great website if you're bored. The site asks you what you're interested in and pops up a random website linked to your interests. This site is great because a lot of valuable content is hard to come by on the internet but with Stumble Upon's abilities it makes this content readily available.  Also each site seems to be a part of Stumble Upon and has their logo at the top of the page along with a thumbs up or down button. Although the site is providing you with links it seems to have control over where you go even on other peoples sites.
